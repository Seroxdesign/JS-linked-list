This is a linked list built in Javascript.

In this project I demonstrate my ability to create and manipulate data in the form of a Linked List

I start by defining a Node class, I will be using these Nodes to form the linked list
I continue to create a linked list class, in this class I will initialise a head Node with a valid data value, it will point to a tail node set to a value of Null.

I have added 11 functions to my linked list class.

One to display the head node, one to display the tail node.

Then I added 2 functions, one to append a node to the end of the linked list and one to prepend a node to the beginning of the list and set it as the head.

I also added a function that allows us to add node in at a given index, the list starts with an index of 0 just like an array would.

There's a function that allows us to delete a node of a certain given data value

There are functions to display the entire linked list and a function to tell us how many nodes are in the list.

Finally I added a function to that takes our singly linked list and turns it into a circular linked list and a function to reverse our linked lists so that the pointers are all reversed,
I implimented this function using a queue which I found favourable to the stack method and the method that uses three pointers to reverse the list.
The time complexity of the reverse function should be O(n)

I want to clean up my code a bit in the upcoming week so I will consider this project only 80% done, thank you (:
